POSTGRE SQL(use \!cls  for deleting in psql terminals)
->IT IS DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
->IT HELPS TO CREATE ,STORE ,RETRIEVE DATA FROM SERVER TO SPECICIFIC PLACE

EG:
FACEBOOK'S ALL DATA ARE IN DATABASES OF FACEBOOK LIKE PIC,CONTENTS ETC THAT IS STORING
WHEN WE SEE COMMENTS OF OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE RETRIEVING DATA FROM SERVER OR DB TO THAT SPEIFIC PLACE FOR US TO SEE

WE CAN SEE RETRIEVED DATA OF PRODUCTS IN THE DARAZ PRODUCT PAGES

-POSTGRE SQL IS RELATION DB PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE


DATABASES CAN CONTAINS TABLES WHERE ARE ROWS(ENTITIES OR USERS OF WHAT TABLE IS ABOUT)
 AND COLUMNS(FEATURES OF WHAT TABLE IS ABOUT)

EG:




RELATION OF TABLES

TABLE: PERSON

ID   NAME    AGE   CAR_ID
1    NICK    16     222
2    BEN     19    

AS WE KNOW BEN HAS NO CAR ID WHICH IMPLIES HE HAD NO CAR
SO WE HAVE ANOTHER TABLE OF CAR USER:

TABLE CAR

CAR_ID  NAME  PRICE
222     NICK  2222
333     NIRAJ 2333


AS WE CAN  SEE RELATION BETWEEN TABLE PERSON AND TABLE CAR WITH SAME USER 'NICK' ON THE BOTH TABLES
THATS RELATION OF TABLES
